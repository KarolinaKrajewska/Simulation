# Simulation
This program runs a short simulation of 5 turns. It creates 10 animals of random class (predators or non-predators) and places them on a 5x5 coordinate system. I wrote it during my fourth year at Bard College as a project outside of class in order to apply for an internship in CrossMinded Games (it was the company's entry test policy).
You can customize size of the coordinate system, number of turns and number of animals in the simulation by changing the values in the initialization of a new Simulation, in the file Program.
The program uses event-based approach to delete dead animals from the coordinate system. It also creates an additional, two-dimensional array called grid[,] that stores additional information about specific tiles. First dimension index specifies which tile is concerned, and second dimension indices provide the following: what are the adjacent tiles (0-3) and which (if any) animals reside on this position in the coordinate system (4-6 for predators, 7-9 for non-predators).
You can trace the process of running a Simulation on the terminal.
